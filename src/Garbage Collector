garbage collection :
a. Criteria for the java garbage collection
1. Nullifying the reference variable
2. Reassigning the reference variable
3. Object created inside a method
4. Island of Isolation

b. The method for requesting JVM to run the Garbage collector
1. System.gcc
2. Runtime class gcc

c. Finalization

Garbage collector is a program which runs inside the JVM. When we run the JVM the GC runs too and when
an object comes out of the program before the GC is run.

Methodology --> Mark and sweep methodology and check which are referenced are marked and which are not referenced
are unmarked and collects all the unmarked

*Fragmentation takes place due to the GC.
Defragmentation takes place after that which is done by the shift and copy method
Copying takes place by copying the content of the memory from  the top memory to the bottom memory and vice versa
So there are two memories in which copying takes place without copying the dereferenced memory.

Garbage Collector can acts on the heap area and also on the Method area.
